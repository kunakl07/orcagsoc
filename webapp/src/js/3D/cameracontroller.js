// A simple camera controller which uses an HTML element as the event
// source for constructing a view matrix. Assign an "onchange"
// function to the controller as follows to receive the updated X and
// Y angles for the camera:
//
//   var controller = new CameraController(canvas);
//   controller.onchange = function(xRot, yRot) { ... };
//
// The view matrix is computed elsewhere.
//
// opt_canvas (an HTMLCanvasElement) and opt_context (a
// WebGLRenderingContext) can be passed in to make the hit detection
// more precise -- only opaque pixels will be considered as the start
// of a drag action.
